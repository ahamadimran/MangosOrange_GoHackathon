                        <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to utilize Figma Design Tool 
                            to create professional-quality designs for web and mobile applications. They will 
                            have a strong understanding of Figma's interface and tools, including design 
                            components, frames, and layers. Students will also be able to collaborate and share 
                            designs with team members through Figma's real-time collaboration features. By the 
                            end of the course, students will have created several designs and prototypes using 
                            Figma.
