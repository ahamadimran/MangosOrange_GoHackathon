                        <p>Learn the fundamentals of PHP programming language and how to work with MS SQL Server 
                            to store and retrieve data. In this course, you'll learn the basics of PHP 
                            programming language and how to use it for server-side web development. You'll also 
                            learn how to use MS SQL Server to store and retrieve data, and how to perform basic 
                            CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on databases using PHP. Additionally, 
                            you'll learn how to build web applications using PHP and MS SQL Server, and how to 
                            secure your applications against common web vulnerabilities. By the end of the 
                            course, you'll have the skills to start building your own PHP applications and 
                            working on real-world projects using MS SQL Server.

                        <h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
                        <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to develop dynamic web 
                            applications using PHP and a database management system (DBMS) such as Microsoft 
                            SQL Server. They will have a solid understanding of front-end web development 
                            concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as server-side scripting and 
                            frameworks such as Laravel or CodeIgniter. Additionally, students will have 
                            experience working with relational databases such as MS SQL Server, enabling them 
                            to design and implement efficient database models. They will also be proficient in 
                            working with web development tools such as Git and Visual Studio Code or PHPStorm. 
                            By the end of the course, students will have developed several web applications and 
                            be able to effectively collaborate with other developers using Git for version control.
