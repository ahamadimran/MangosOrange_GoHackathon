                        <h2>Node Js</h2>
                        <p>Learn the popular server-side JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable 
                            and high-performance applications. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals 
                            of Node.js, including working with the Node.js event loop, asynchronous programming, 
                            and the Node.js module system. You'll also learn how to work with Node.js frameworks 
                            and libraries such as Express and Socket.io, and how to use Node.js for database 
                            connectivity with MongoDB and other databases. Additionally, you'll learn how to 
                            use Node.js for real-time communication with WebSockets, how to build RESTful APIs, 
                            and how to deploy Node.js applications to the cloud with platforms like AWS and 
                            Heroku. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills to start building your own 
                            Node.js applications and working on real-world Node.js projects.

                        <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to develop scalable and 
                            high-performance web applications using Node.js. They will have a solid 
                            understanding of Node.js's event-driven architecture, asynchronous programming, 
                            and popular frameworks such as Express.js and Socket.IO. Additionally, students 
                            will have experience working with databases, RESTful APIs, and server-side 
                            rendering. They will also be proficient in working with web development tools 
                            such as Git, Docker, and AWS. By the end of the course, students will have 
                            developed several web applications using Node.js and be able to effectively 
                            collaborate with other developers.
