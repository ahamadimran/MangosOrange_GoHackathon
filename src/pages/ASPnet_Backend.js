                        <h2>ASP.Net</h2>
                        <p>Learn the popular framework used to build dynamic web applications with the .NET 
                            platform. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of ASP.NET, including 
                            building web pages with Razor syntax, working with data using Entity Framework, 
                            and handling user input with forms and validation. You'll also learn how to use 
                            ASP.NET to build APIs, handle authentication and authorization, and deploy your 
                            applications to the cloud with Azure. Additionally, you'll learn how to work with 
                            popular ASP.NET frameworks, such as ASP.NET Core and SignalR. By the end of the 
                            course, you'll have the skills to start building your own ASP.NET applications and 
                            working on real-world ASP.NET projects.
