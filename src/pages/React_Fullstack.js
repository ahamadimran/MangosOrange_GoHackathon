                        <h2>REACT, NODE.JS, MONGO DB</h2>
                        <p>Learn the fundamentals of modern web development with React, NodeJS, and MongoDB. 
                            In this course, you'll learn how to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces 
                            using React, a popular JavaScript library for building front-end web applications. 
                            You'll also learn how to use NodeJS, a powerful JavaScript runtime, to build 
                            back-end web applications and APIs. Additionally, you'll learn how to use MongoDB, 
                            a popular NoSQL database, to store and retrieve data from your applications. By 
                            the end of the course, you'll have the skills to build full-stack web applications 
                            using React, NodeJS, and MongoDB, and you'll be ready to work on real-world web 
                            development projects.

                        <h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
                        <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to develop scalable and 
                            responsive web applications using React, NodeJS, and a NoSQL database management 
                            system (DBMS) such as MongoDB. They will have a solid understanding of front-end 
                            web development concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as server-side 
                            scripting and frameworks such as Express or NestJS. Additionally, students will 
                            have experience working with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, enabling them to 
                            design and implement efficient database models. They will also be proficient in 
                            working with web development tools such as Git and VS Code or WebStorm. By the 
                            end of the course, students will have developed several web applications and be 
                            able to effectively collaborate with other developers using Git for version control.
