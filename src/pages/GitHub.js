                        <p>This course will teach you the basics of version control with Git and its integration 
                            with GitHub. You'll learn how to create and manage repositories, commit changes, and 
                            collaborate with others using these tools. By the end of the course, you'll have the 
                            skills to manage your projects and work effectively with other developers. <br />
                        </p>
                        <p> On GitHub, developers can host their code repositories, collaborate with others, 
                            track issues and bugs, and contribute to open-source projects. It's a popular 
                            platform for software development and is used by millions of developers around the 
                            world.

                        <h2>Course Coverage</h2>
                        <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes 
                            made to their code over time. GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting 
                            for Git repositories and additional collaboration features. Version control is the 
                            management of changes to documents, computer programs, and other collections of 
                            information, topics that are typically covered:
