                        <p>Learn the set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to 
                            build, test, and deploy software faster and more reliably. In this course, you'll 
                            learn the fundamentals of DevOps, including continuous integration and continuous 
                            delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), configuration management, and 
                            containerization with Docker and Kubernetes. You'll also learn how to use popular 
                            DevOps tools such as Git, Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform, and how to work with 
                            cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Additionally, you'll learn how 
                            to monitor and troubleshoot your applications using tools like ELK stack and 
                            Prometheus. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills to start working on 
                            DevOps projects and implement DevOps practices in your organization.
