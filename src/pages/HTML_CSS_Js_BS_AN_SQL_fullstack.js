                        <p>Learn the fundamentals of web development and how to create dynamic web applications 
                            using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ASP.Net, and MySQL. In this course, you'll 
                            learn the basics of front-end web development, including HTML markup, CSS styling, 
                            and JavaScript programming. You'll also learn how to use Bootstrap to create 
                            responsive and mobile-friendly web designs. Additionally, you'll learn how to create 
                            back-end web applications using ASP.Net and connect them to a MySQL database to 
                            store and retrieve data. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills to start 
                            building your own web applications and working on real-world web development 
                            projects.
