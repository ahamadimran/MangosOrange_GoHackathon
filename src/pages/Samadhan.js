                            <p>This event brings real industry problem statements to different teams from across the country,
                               the teams are given specific problem statements for which they develop solutions. Professional
                               industry mentors evaluate the level and choose the winning team. The winning team gets the prize
                               money.
                               The story does not end here, it goes beyond that, here most of the hackathons end up with the
                               winning team, and in this event, the opportunity is for everybody who participates in it.
                               All the Participating teams who developed their solutions (both winning and losing oneâ€™s) will
                               be now assigned to industry mentors for specific periods. The teams will focus on developing the
                               solution under the mentorship of the expert. The team who will produce the best results in the
                               desired timeframe will be selected for a paid internship for 6 months (or for a specific
                               duration of the project development)
                               On successful completion of the project, the team will have options either to continue paid
                               internship with a new project or get a job opportunity (if they have completed their studies by
                               that time.)
                               Go hackathon aims at providing continuous help and support to all the participants of their
                               events and developing a life-long bond of learning, earning, and contributing back. The aim is
                               to impact industry and society by providing continuous innovative solutions to real problems
