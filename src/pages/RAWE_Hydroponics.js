                        <p>Learn each and every aspect of hydroponics, along with marketing of hydroponically 
                            grown products and their packaging. This course will cover all the technical and 
                            commercial aspects of hydroponic farming. At the end of this course the trainee 
                            will be able to start their own hydroponic farm and will have a solid business 
                            plan which will cover everything from initial seeding to final packaging.<br />
