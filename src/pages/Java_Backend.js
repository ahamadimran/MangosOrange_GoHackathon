                        <h2>Java</h2>
                        <p>Learn one of the most popular programming languages used in a wide variety of 
                            applications, from building Android apps to developing enterprise-level software. 
                            In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of Java syntax, data types, and 
                            control structures, as well as object-oriented programming principles, such as 
                            inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. You'll also learn how to work with 
                            Java libraries and frameworks, such as Spring and Hibernate, and how to use Java 
                            for web development with technologies such as Servlets and JSP. Additionally, 
                            you'll learn how to use Java for mobile development with Android, as well as how 
                            to build desktop applications with JavaFX. By the end of the course, you'll have 
                            the skills to start building your own Java applications and working on real-world 
                            Java projects.
