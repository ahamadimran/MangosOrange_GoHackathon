                        <h2>DATA SCIENCE</h2>
                        <p>Learn the fundamentals of data analysis and machine learning, and how to use these 
                            techniques to extract insights and value from data. In this course, you'll learn 
                            the basics of Python programming language and how to use popular Python libraries 
                            such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization. You'll 
                            also learn how to use machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow 
                            to build and train models. Additionally, you'll learn how to clean, transform, 
                            and prepare data for analysis, and how to apply statistical techniques to identify 
                            patterns and trends in data. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills to 
                            start working on data science projects and applying data science techniques to solve 
                            real-world problems.

                        <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to apply data science techniques 
                            to analyze and solve real-world problems. They will have a solid understanding of 
                            statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms. 
                            Additionally, students will have experience working with popular data science tools 
                            such as Python, R, and SQL, enabling them to clean and preprocess data, perform 
                            exploratory data analysis, and build predictive models. They will also be proficient 
                            in working with big data tools such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. By the end of 
                            the course, students will have developed several data-driven projects and be able to 
                            effectively collaborate with other developers using Git for version control.
