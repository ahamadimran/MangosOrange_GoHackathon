                        <p>Learn the server-side scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive web 
                            pages. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of PHP syntax, data types, 
                            and control structures, as well as how to work with functions, arrays, and objects. 
                            You'll also learn how to use PHP to interact with databases, handle user input, and 
                            create web forms. In addition, you'll learn how to work with popular PHP frameworks 
                            such as Laravel and CodeIgniter, as well as how to use PHP to create APIs and 
                            interact with external APIs. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills to 
                            start building your own PHP applications and working on real-world PHP projects.
