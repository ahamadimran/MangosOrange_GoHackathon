                        <h2>Java</h2>
                        <p>Learn one of the most popular programming languages used in a wide variety of 
                            applications, from building Android apps to developing enterprise-level software. 
                            In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of Java syntax, data types, and 
                            control structures, as well as object-oriented programming principles, such as 
                            inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. You'll also learn how to work with 
                            Java libraries and frameworks, such as Spring and Hibernate, and how to use Java 
                            for web development with technologies such as Servlets and JSP. By the end of the 
                            course, you'll have the skills to start building your own Java applications and 
                            working on real-world Java projects.

                        <h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
                        <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to develop robust and scalable 
                            web applications using Java. They will have a solid understanding of Java's syntax, 
                            object-oriented programming principles, and popular Java frameworks such as Spring 
                            and Hibernate. Additionally, students will have experience working with databases, 
                            RESTful APIs, and server-side rendering. By the end of the course, students will 
                            have developed several full-stack web applications and be able to effectively 
                            collaborate with other developers using Git for version control.
